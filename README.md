# Minimal Developer Portfolio
Here is a minimal landing page for developers!

Developers used to be observers and reticent. So their code does all the talking stuff.<br>
You might have heard a famous quote by Linus Torvald:
**"Talk is cheap, Show me the code!"**

## Themes

I have created and used the Aqua green theme.
You can customize and create your own if it doesn't match your taste!

GitHub makes it easy to create personal websites. Follow this link - [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/) to know how, or follow the steps below:

I assume you already have a GitHub account!
* Fork or clone this repo
* Make certain changes, like name & links
* Go to Repo setting and scroll down to GitHub Pages
* In the source section, select your branch and click on Save.
Voila! Your site should be live at `https://{username}.github.io`
